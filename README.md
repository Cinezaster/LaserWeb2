##Sponsors

So how can I help?

*Easy! Pick a contributor, and show them you care! *

If you sell laser machines / parts / electronics / anything remotely related - I am happy to say we'll gladly take your bribe in exchange for sticking your logo on our SPONSORS page and linking to your stores! We'll probably even hook up the hardware you donate and figure out how it works and add that info/specifics/settings to this Wiki! If you have any business common sense, you can see that it is a pretty good ROI out of your marketing budget (;



#Usage Instructions:

1. Go to [http://openhardwarecoza.github.io/LaserWeb2/](http://openhardwarecoza.github.io/LaserWeb2/)
2. Install Serial Port JSON Server https://github.com/chilipeppr/serial-port-json-server/releases
3. Click the Settings tab in LaserWeb2's web interface and configure for your machine, IP of SPJS, GCODE dialect, etc
4. Connect and PLAY

## Internal module development
It would be more maintainable if we could develop more functional modules, that are tested.

<i>Example</i>: grbl.js has test code. It is a stand alone module that parses messages from a grbl device and stores all data in the grbl object, created by ` var grbl = new Grbl()` 
### how to test
``` 
npm install // installs mocha and chai
npm test // runs test code on grbl.js
```

##History

Laserweb (https://github.com/openhardwarecoza/LaserWeb) was born out of a need! Last year when I gave up on getting a certain well known open source java based laser cutting software to work and my skills at the time didnt allow me to complete my development inside Chilipeppr - i caved in and did what I could to help myself get going! The result of which astounds even me! In just over three months LaserWeb grew to be a massively successful opensource project!  But its not without its flaws...

Thus, this here is it's successor: LaserWeb2!

Want to get involved? Simple - we have a couple of Contributors on the project, who have devoted time and effort into making LaserWeb better than it was before they joined. Many of these contributors do it for nothing more than the passion of working on an open source project, and some don't even own a laser.

Through the wonder that is the global open source community, however, lack of a laser hasn't stopped them! If you follow our team on Google Plus you'll know that we sometimes go as far as having three or four people in different time zones, collaborating on code, while having someone else in the team test it out on real hardware. It has not been easy, but we won't let that stop us!
